# Turtle_race
A game that prompts the user to bet on a color of a turtle. Once they have placed their bet, the race begins. Once the first turtle reaches the end of the screen, the game stops announcing the winner and compares it with the user's bet.
The idea of the game is to show how the Instances of a Class can have different States (i.e. color, movement, location)
